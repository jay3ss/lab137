<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack data structure</a>.
This series defines what a stack is and what it does, then implement a
link-based stack</em></p>
<h2>What is a Stack?</h2>
<p>A stack is a data structure that holds data in
<abbr title="Last In First Out">LIFO</abbr> order. This means that whatever was
the most recent "thing" to be put onto the stack will be the first to be
removed.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you are washing a stack of dirty dishes. As you're
washing, every time you clean one plate you pull another off the top of the
stack of dirty dishes. If someone wants to give you more dishes to wash they're
going to put them on top of your stack.</p>
<p><img alt="A stack of dirty dishes" src="https://lab137.org/img/stack_of_plates.jpg"></p>
<p>That's pretty much what the stack data structure is. It's an ordered collection
of things (with the most recently added thing at the top) and you can perform
certain  operations on it. You can</p>
<ul>
<li>see if the stack is empty</li>
<li>see how many things are in it</li>
<li>take an item off of the top (pop!)</li>
<li>add something to the top (push!)</li>
<li>see what the item at the top is (peek!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can reword the above list into pseudocode that will make our lives easier
when we start writing some code (it's usually a good idea to put your ideas
into pseudocode before writing actual code).</p>
<ol>
<li><code>(new Stack()).isEmpty() = True</code></li>
<li><code>(new Stack()).pop() = False</code></li>
<li><code>(new Stack()).peek() = error</code></li>
<li><code>(a_stack.push(item)).isEmpty() = False</code></li>
<li><code>(a_stack.push(item)).peek() = item</code></li>
<li><code>(a_stack.push(item)).pop() = True</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In order, this is what they mean</p>
<ol>
<li>A new stack should be empty</li>
<li>You can't take something off the top of an empty stack</li>
<li>Trying to see what's at the top of an empty stack results in an error</li>
<li>A stack with something in it isn't empty</li>
<li>Looking (peeking) at the top gives you the thing that was most recently
   added</li>
<li>You can remove something from a non-empty stack</li>
</ol>
<p>This may sound somewhat similar to an array. It is, and a stack can be
implemented using an array. But, elements in an array can be accessed at will
while elements in a stack are accessed in LIFO order.</p>
<h3>Some Applications of Stacks</h3>
<p>But, what's the point? Why would we want to have a data structure that
remembers which dish we need to wash next? Stacks are actually pretty useful
and common in computing.</p>
<p>Remember, they keep track of a sequence of elements with the most recent
element at the beginning of the stack. So, we can use a stack to keep track of
which characters have been entered by a user, keeping track of cities visited
when finding a flight path between different cities (backtracking), and
computers use them to hold local variables and return addresses for function
calls (stack frame).</p>
<h3>Implementations of Stacks</h3>
<p>There are at least two different ways that we can make a stack: using an array
(or a list in Python) or using a chain of nodes (which we'll call a linked
stack). Here, we're going with a linked stack.</p>
<h2>The Linked Stack</h2>
<p><em>The following discussion is a general discussion about link-based data
structures versus array-based data structures. For Python, the overhead of the
rest of your code can be so large that the overhead of an array-based vs
link-based data structures may not make much of a difference. But, this is
still a useful discussion nonetheless.</em></p>
<p>Think of an array and how every element in an array is stored in contiguous
blocks of memory, such as the example in the figure below. Each cell is a block
of memory and the number above the cell is its address. When you want to
access an element of an array you use an index such as <code>arr[4]</code> to access the
fifth element of the array (assuming zero indexing). This is actually an offset
from the address of the first element in the array. This gives us quick and
direct access to the data. This quick and direct access comes at a cost.</p>
<p><img alt="A block of memory representing an array" src="https://lab137.org/img/array.svg"></p>
<p>When an array has data added to it and it is, extra memory must be allocated
to make room for the data (and then some) and the data must be copied to the
new memory location. This is one of the costs of using an array, the time that
it takes to allocate more space for the array and copying its data to the newly
allocated space. We could preallocate more room for the data ahead of time, but
that would be potentially wasted space (this is actually what Python does with
lists) and increases the complexity of the data structure.</p>
<p>What about <em>removing</em> data? If we need to remove data at the end of the array
then we're fine. But, removing data anywhere else requires us to either
remember which elements have been removed (to guard against stale data), or to
readjust all the following elements.</p>
<p>If we're going to mostly be reading and updating data, or if we know how much
space our stack will need then an array is a good choice to use as the data
store for a stack. Otherwise, if we're going to be doing a lot of adding and
removing data then we should look into using a linked stack.</p>
<p>A linked stack is made of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data_structure">set of nodes that are linked
together</a> by
references, a.k.a the link. Depending on the language, this reference can
be a pointer variable (like in C++) or a variable that holds a reference to the
next node in the chain (what we're going to do with Python). (The point is that
instead of using contiguous memory addresses a linked stack (or linked data
structures in general) use memory from wherever the system allocates space for
you. This means that, for the most part, linked stacks can be as large as you
need them to be.)</p>
<p>So, a node is an object (<strong>don't</strong> think of the CS idea of an object just yet!)
that holds data and a reference to another node. If there is no other node,
then that reference is <code>None</code> in Python (or, <code>nullptr</code> in C++). In the figure
below, the left side of the node is the data and the right side is a reference
to the next node indicated by an arrow.</p>
<p><img alt="A single node" src="https://lab137.org/img/node_scoured.svg"></p>
<p>A chain of nodes is shown in the figure below. The head consists of a head node
and the nodes following it. The end of the chain is the block all the way to
the right with an "X" in it. This "X" represents a reference to <code>None</code> in
Python (or <code>nullptr</code> in C++) indicating the end of the chain.</p>
<p><img alt="A stack of dirty dishes" src="https://lab137.org/img/stack_of_plates.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, linked data structures aren't perfect and there will be some tradeoffs to
using one versus using an array. First, they take more memory because they must
contain a reference to the next node in each node in the chain. Second, they do
not support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access">random access</a>. You
must start with the head of the structure and traverse the chain until you
reach the desired entry.</p>
<h2>The Stack Interface</h2>
<p>We're going to start with defining an interface for the stack then
move on to implementing the linked stack in the <a href="https://lab137.org/articles/building-a-linked-stack-part-2/">next
article</a>. The point of
making an interface is to make sure that we implement the correct methods in
our implementation. Now, this may not seem like it's such a big deal right now
(after all, we're only implementing on type of stack, right?), but if we wanted
to make a different type of stack then we can inherit from this interface and
code to the specifications that are laid out in it (see
<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/108681">these</a>
<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/108267">answers on SE</a>).</p>
<p>Anyways, we're going to use Python's <code>abc</code> module to create an <em>interface</em> that
we'll use later on in our linked stack <em>implementation</em>. By using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.ABC"><code>abc.ABC</code> class</a> and the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod"><code>abc.abstractmethod</code>
decorator</a>, we
can insure that who ever uses our interface implements it to the
specifications by implementing the methods that use the <code>abc.abstractmethod</code>
decorator. If they're not implemented, then a <code>TypeError</code> will be raised when
the class is attempted to be instantiated. You can get the code from a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jay3ss/5641fa3de11129118dc2fae305135ba8">gist
on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>An abstract base class (which is what the interface here is) cannot be
instantiated, hence the word <em>abstract</em>. Go ahead and try, I did. The result
was</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">TypeError</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Can</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">instantiate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">abstract</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">StackInterface</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">abstract</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">methods</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">is_empty</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">peek</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">pop</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">push</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is good because we've described a stack as a data structure that has these
methods. Any class that subclasses the <code>StackInterface</code> class <strong>must</strong>
implement these methods and therefore live up to the specification that we
wrote. If these methods haven't been implemented, then the specifications have
not been met and the subclass can't be instantiated. Neat!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article we talked about what a stack is, what a linked stack is, and
then we wrote an interface for a stack. In the <a href="https://lab137.org/articles/building-a-linked-stack-part-2/">next
article</a>, we'll start
implementing the linked stack by implementing the <code>push</code> method.</p>
