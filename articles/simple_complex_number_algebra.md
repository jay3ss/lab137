I decided to start reviewing some of my controls courses from university to
brush up on the fundamentals. While reviewing, I had an "Oh shit" moment when I
realized that I've forgotten some *really* basic math. Namely, working with
complex numbers. I decided to write this article so that I can easily find a
reference if I ever need it (hopefully it helps you too). (BIG thanks to Dr.
Tabrizi for putting together notes that are very comprehensible.)

## General Form of a Complex Number

Complex numbers can be written in two forms: rectangular and polar. They live
in the 2-dimensional complex plane with the horizontal axis is called the
"real" axis while the vertical axis is called the "imaginary" axis. The figure
below demonstrates this nicely.

### Rectangular Form

The rectangular form of a complex number is as follows

$$
Z = a + jb
$$

### Polar Form



### Summary

The list below summarizes the two different forms

- *Rectangular:* $Z = a + jb$  <!-- $\text{Z} = \text{a} + \text{jb}$ -->
- *Polar:* $Z = \|r\| e^\phi$ <!-- \| \text{r} \| \text{e} ^{\phi}$ -->
