Hi! You've somehow found me and now you're wondering who the hell I am. Well,
I'm no one special. Really. Just some guy writing articles for himself so he
doesn't forget some of what he's learned and to, hopefully, help out anyone
else who may have encountered the same issues. That's it.

I also happen to be an electrical engineer with a masters in controls. I've
done some robotics, embedded device development, and some research in
[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_car)
[autonomous vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car).

If you've found my writing useful, then great! Otherwise, if you don't like
what I've written or feel like you've been wronged by wasting your time reading
the content here then please [click here for a refund](https://google.com).

Now, if you feel like something that I've written is incorrect or can perhaps be
done better then by all means leave a comment (or
[issue a pull request](https://github.com/jay3ss/lab137/issues)!).

Also, please remember that all opinions are mine and not a reflection of
anyone else (or any organization that I may be associated with).

## What's with the name?

The number 137 comes from the
[fine-structure constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant)
which is approximately <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> and is a fundamental
physical constant (&alpha;) and is the [best known, dimensionless fundamental
physical constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant#Choice_of_units).
The number 137 is also [significant
physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/137_(number)#In_physics).

As for the "Lab" portion, why not?
